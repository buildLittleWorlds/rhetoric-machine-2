The purpose of this site is to create a "dramatized argument" against an essay I disagree with. The site will link to this other essay and provide a brief summary of its arguments. Then the site will "do something" that will show the shortcomings of that argument. Perhaps written arguments will be provided in some form as well.

## summary of Aleberto Romero essay
The document "Why generative AI scares artists but not writers" by Alberto Romero discusses the differential impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on artists and writers. The author posits that while many professions are threatened by generative AI, artists seem to be more concerned than writers. This is due to two primary factors:

1. **Visual Artistry and Style:** The author suggests that the "style" of an artist, a unique combination of elements that identifies their work, is more distinct and recognizable in visual art than in writing. Generative AI's ability to imitate and remix data makes artists vulnerable. Although AI's imitation is usually not perfect, the author argues that the majority of art consumers, who are not artists themselves, may not discern these imperfections.

2. **Perception of Images and Language:** The author contends that humans are less sensitive to imperfections in images than in text. Even minor mistakes in language can disrupt its meaning, making it less believable. Conversely, slight deviations in visual art are often overlooked, making it a more forgiving medium for AI generation.

In conclusion, the author asserts that writers are less threatened by generative AI than artists because written text relies less on style, a strength of AI, than images. Additionally, the perfection required in language generation is currently beyond AI's capabilities, while the relatively higher tolerance for imperfections in visual art makes it an easier target for AI.
