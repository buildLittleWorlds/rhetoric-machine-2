<h1>Passage #4</h1>
<h2>Original Passage</h2>
<p>From <em>Rushmore</em></p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5RbdReBMLE">Bill Murray chapel speech</a>
<p>Herman Blume: You guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here because the fact is you go to one of the best schools in the country: Rushmore. Now, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich and you're going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: Take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs and take them down. Just remember, they can buy anything but they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget it. Thank you.</p>
<h2>After the rhetoric machine</h2>
<p>New rhetorical form: the "I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd" speech from <em>Pulp Fiction</em></p>
<p>Listen and listen well, brothers and sisters of Rushmore's grand arena. Fortune has laid down an opulent path for some; you dwell in the lap of luxury, a providence you never earned but wear like a second skin. However, for those who scratch and claw in the shadows of these ivory towers, hear my gospel: Set your aim upon those born with gilded spoons in their mouths. Lock 'em in your sights and unleash Hell's fury upon them.</p>
<p>It is an ancient truth, etched in stone and whispered by the winds of adversity, 'A man may wrap himself in the finest silks and bathe in oceans of gold, but backbone, that unyielding pillar of character, is a virtue money shall never conquer.' Stand tall, people, be you the keepers of your destiny. Proclaim to the heavens and the earth that in this divine drama, you are not the undercard, you are the main event!</p>
<p>Be you the archangels in this theatre of life, brandishing flaming swords of willpower, ambition, and unbreakable spirit. When they rest in the splendor of their ill-gotten kingdoms, let them tremble at the mere thought of your existence. Let them realize, with hearts pounding and souls quivering, that you are the force, the tempest, the uncontrollable maelstrom that their filthy lucre can't quell.</p>
<p>The sands of time are ever-flowing, and in these grand chambers where futures are crafted and destinies decided, let your voice echo as a thunderclap, a divine proclamation that shakes the very foundations of this gilded edifice. Remind them, with every fiber of your being, that when the history of this place is written, when the tales of Rushmore are told to future generations, it will not be their names alone that resound through eternity. No, your names will be carved alongside theirs, indelible and unyielding. Take heed, and let this be your scripture. Amen.</p>
