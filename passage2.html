<h1>Passage #2</h1>
<h2>Original Passage</h2>
<p>From <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em></p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Lf8GtMe4M">Coffee is for closers</a>
<p>Blake: Let me have your attention for a moment! So you're talking about what? You're talking about...(puts out his cigarette)...bitching about that sale you shot, some son of a bitch that doesn't want to buy, somebody that doesn't want what you're selling, some broad you're trying to screw and so forth. Let's talk about something important. Are they all here?</p>
<p>Williamson: All but one.</p>
<p>Blake: Well, I'm going anyway. Let's talk about something important! (to Levene) Put that coffee down!! Coffee's for closers only. (Levene scoffs) Do you think I'm fucking with you? I am not fucking with you. I'm here from downtown. I'm here from Mitch and Murray. And I'm here on a mission of mercy. Your name's Levene?</p>
<p>Levene: Yeah.</p>
<p>Blake: You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch?</p>
<p>Moss: I don't have to listen to this shit.</p>
<p>Blake: You certainly don't pal. 'Cause the good news is -- you're fired. The bad news is you've got, all you got, just one week to regain your jobs, starting tonight. Starting with tonights sit. Oh, have I got your attention now? Good. 'Cause we're adding a little something to this months sales contest. As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anyone want to see second prize? Second prize's a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired. You get the picture? You're laughing now? You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them! You can't close the leads you're given, you can't close shit, you ARE shit, hit the bricks pal and beat it 'cause you are going out!!!</p>
<p>Levene: The leads are weak.</p>
<p>Blake: 'The leads are weak.' Fucking leads are weak? You're weak. I've been in this business fifteen years.</p>
<p>Moss: What's your name?</p>
<p>Blake: FUCK YOU, that's my name!! You know why, Mister? 'Cause you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight, I drove a eighty thousand dollar BMW. That's my name!!</p>
<h2>After the rhetoric machine</h2>
<p>New rhetorical form: a statistical report</p>
<h3>Technical Report on Sales Performance Metrics and Incentive Schemes</h3>
<h4>Executive Summary:</h4>
<p>This report aims to provide an analytical overview of the current sales performance metrics and a proposed revision to the incentive structure for the sales team, in an effort to increase revenue and job satisfaction.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The focus of this analysis is on the Sales Department, where personnel have reported concerns about lead quality and the existing reward system. The objective is to evaluate these concerns against data and provide actionable recommendations.</p>
<h4>Methodology</h4>
<p>Data from the Mitch and Murray database were analyzed to identify the efficacy of lead conversion among the sales team. These were divided into different lead categories: High-quality, Moderate, and Low-quality.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>The analysis shows that the sales team has not been converting leads effectively. The poor performance does not solely hinge on lead quality. From the dataset:</p>
<p>First prize, a Cadillac Eldorado, is statistically correlated with closing High-quality leads (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Second prize, a set of steak knives, shows a moderate correlation with closing Moderate leads (p = 0.15).</p>
<p>Failure to close any leads is associated with job termination within the next review cycle (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The data clearly refutes the claim that "the leads are weak." On the contrary, the performance issues are attributable to the sales staff. Sales personnel driving entry-level vehicles, such as a Hyundai, show an 80% lower closing rate than those driving premium vehicles like an $80,000 BMW. Therefore, your job performance, and not your leads, determines your rewards.</p>
<h4>Conclusion and Recommendations</h4>
<p>It is suggested that sales staff who are unable to meet the minimum lead conversion rate be given one week to improve performance. Should they fail, the data supports immediate termination.</p>
<br/>
<p>This report is submitted as a mission of analytical scrutiny and is not intended to mock or belittle the sales staff. The aim is to provide a factual basis for performance assessment and improve overall productivity.</p>
<h2>Again</h2>
<p>New rhetorical form: a zen koan</p>
<p>In a room where words flutter, the master points to the empty cup. "For those who close, the cup fills. For those who cannot, even the cup is too much." What is your name? It is the echo of your own footsteps.</p>
