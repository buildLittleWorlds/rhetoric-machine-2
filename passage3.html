<h1>Passage #3</h1>
<h2>Original Passage</h2>
<p>From <em>Pulp Fiction</em></p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh3Wftae0c0">I'm trying to be the shepherd (start at the 1:30 mark)</a>
<p>JULES: There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years.  And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.  I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.</p>

<p>New rhetorical form: a recipe</p>
<h3>Recipe for the Path of the Righteous and the Struggles of Life</h3>
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup of Righteousness</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of Selfish Inequities</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of Tyranny of Evil Men</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of Charity and Goodwill</li>
    <li>1 tsp of Weak Souls</li>
    <li>A pinch of Darkness</li>
    <li>A sprinkle of Vengeance and Furious Anger</li>
    <li>1 "Mr. .45" or an equivalent guardian</li>
    <li>A dash of Moral Uncertainty</li>
    <li>A garnish of Struggle to Improve</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions:</h4> 

<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Foundation: Start with a base of Righteousness, evenly spread, but be prepared for obstacles. Mix in the Selfish Inequities and the Tyranny of Evil Men for added complexity.</li>
    <li>Shepherd the Weak: Add Charity and Goodwill into the mixture. Stir in the Weak Souls, and blend until they are safely shepherded through the Darkness.</li>
    <li>Introduce the Guardian: If using a "Mr. .45", make sure it's fully integrated into your blend. This will be your shepherd or protector against the valley of darkness.</li>
    <li>Address the Evils: In a separate bowl, combine Vengeance and Furious Anger. Make sure it's potent enough to deal with those who try to poison and destroy your brothers.</li>
    <li>Identity Check: Pause and reflect. Decide who in this recipe is the evil man, the righteous man, and the shepherd. This can change the flavor profile dramatically.</li>
    <li>Adjust to Reality: No matter what you'd like to think, it's often true that you might not be the righteous or the shepherd but the weak or the tyranny of evil men. Adjust seasoning accordingly.</li>
    <li>Strive for Better: Before serving, add a garnish of Struggle to Improve. Whether you are the weak or the evil, a pinch of this can make all the difference in the end result.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy your complex but insightful dish. Remember, each time you prepare it, the ingredients and your role may change, making it a continually evolving culinary experience.</p>
